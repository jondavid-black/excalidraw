# Implementation Plan: Upgrade jsdom to latest version

**Branch**: `001-upgrade-jsdom` | **Date**: November 9, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-upgrade-jsdom/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by `/speckit.plan` and details the implementation for upgrading jsdom to the latest version to resolve a critical vulnerability.

## Summary

Upgrade the jsdom dependency to the latest available version across all relevant packages in the monorepo to eliminate known vulnerabilities. Ensure that no high vulnerabilities remain by running `yarn secure` (which runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`). All automated tests must pass post-upgrade, and the change must be documented in the changelog. No research blockers or unknowns remain for this upgrade.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict mode), Node.js >= 24, React 24+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Sentry, Docusaurus (docs), Crowdin (i18n)  
**Storage**: Local-first (browser), optional external services (pluggable), persistent storage via external interfaces  
**Testing**: Vitest, Jest, Playwright (E2E), CI: typecheck, lint, unit/integration/security scans  
**Target Platform**: Linux server/container, browser (PWA), air-gapped/single-container deploys  
**Project Type**: Single-container web app (default), supports modular packaging  
**Performance Goals**: Fast startup, low latency, minimal bundle size, responsive real-time collaboration  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 latency, <100MB memory for container, offline-capable, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ concurrent users, large diagrams, multi-team collaboration

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- Security: Threat model documented, secrets managed via env/secret provider, CI vulnerability scan required
- Single-Container Deployability: Plan must specify how feature/package will work in default container image, config via env/files, health endpoints
- Test-First: Automated tests required for new features/bugfixes, CI gates for typecheck/lint/unit/integration/security
- Performance: Explicit perf goals and budgets for user-facing features, CI enforcement if practical
- UX/Accessibility: Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA for primary flows, robust under conflict/merge scenarios
- Observability/Versioning: Structured logs, changelog, migration notes for breaking changes

packages/               # Shared libraries: element, excalidraw, math, utils, common

```

**Structure Decision**: The upgrade will be performed in the main monorepo, affecting any package or app that depends on jsdom. The relevant directories are:

- `excalidraw-app/` (main application)
- `packages/` (shared libraries: element, excalidraw, math, utils, common)
- `examples/` (example integrations)
- `scripts/` (build, release, CI/CD scripts)
- `dev-docs/` (documentation site)
- `public/` (static assets)

The feature documentation and planning artifacts are located in `specs/001-upgrade-jsdom/`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
